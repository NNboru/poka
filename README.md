# [my 1st website](http://poka.pythonanywhere.com/) ðŸ˜Ž

### This website contains 3 projects -
- #### [CSV Analyser](https://poka.pythonanywhere.com/plotYourFile) (also part of [Mathbot](https://github.com/nnboru/botbase) project)
  Here you upload a csv file and this tool lets you draw graphs between columns - _scatter-plot_, _pie-chart_, _bar-graph_, _histogram_ and _line-plot_.
- #### [Equation Plotter](https://poka.pythonanywhere.com/EquationPlotter) (also part of [Mathbot](https://github.com/nnboru/botbase) project)
  Here you can enter any implicit equation of 2 variables x & y (like `tan(x*y)=log(x/y)+x`) and this tool will plot its graph in euclidean plane.
- #### [Blog Maker](https://poka.pythonanywhere.com/myPage)
  Using simple drag-and-drop feature you can create and host your own web-page. You can save and come back later to edit again, and can also share the url with others!
